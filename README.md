# CSS Variables with JS

This repo comes from a Wes Bos start file (javascript30.com). This one deals with css variables being able to update vanilla JS
without the use of a less/sass compiler. I started with the boilerplate code, followed parts of the tutorial and then I customized some elements.

This is also a repo for experimenting with evolving css features to try like custom properties.

In particular some react native examples and how easy the process of making variables run natively on a mobile device.
