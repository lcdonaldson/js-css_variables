# CSS Variables with JS

This repo is another start file from javascript30.com, this one deals with css variables being able to update with vanilla JS
without the use of less/sass compiler. I started with the boilerplate code, followed parts of the tutorial and then I customized some elements.

This is also a repo for experimenting with evolving css features to try like custom properties.

In particular some react native examples and how easy the process of making variables run natively on a mobile device.
