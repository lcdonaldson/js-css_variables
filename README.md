# CSS Variables with JS

Yet another start file from javascript30.com, this one dealing with css variables being able to update with vanilla JS
without the use of less/sass compiler. I started with the boilerplate code, followed parts of the tutorial and then I customized some elements.

This is also a good general repo for evolving css (no preprocessor) features to try out as they come along like custom properties.

In particular some react native examples and how easy the process of making variables to run natively on a device.
