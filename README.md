# CSS Variables with JS

Yet another start file from javascript30.com, this one dealing with css variables being able to update with vanilla JS
without the use of less/sass compiler. Started with the boilerplate code, followed the tutorial and then customized some elements.

This is also a good general repo for evolving css (no-preprocessor) features to try out as they come along.

In particular some react native examples and how easy the process of making variables to run natively on a device without a browser.
